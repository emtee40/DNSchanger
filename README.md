# DNSChanger
DNSChanger Android app 

This app can be used to set DNS for mobile/WiFi network on Android phone.
  
Android has no option of setting DNS for mobile internet, so this app can help you to set DNS in that case.
  
This App requires root access as we need to use iptables. 
  
Advantage: No Android VPN technique, no battery loss.
  
DroidScript(JavaScript) has been used to develop this App.
